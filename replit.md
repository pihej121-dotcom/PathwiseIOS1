## Recent Changes (September 2025 - October 2025)

### Tabbed Dashboard - Single-Page Experience (October 2025)
- **Purpose**: Eliminate navigation complexity - all features accessible from one dashboard page
- **Implementation**: Tabbed Dashboard where ALL features are embedded without page navigation
- **Key Changes**:
  - Dashboard.tsx redesigned with shadcn Tabs component - 8 tabs total (Overview + 7 features)
  - All feature components updated to support embedded mode with conditional Layout rendering
  - Features: Resume Analysis, Career Roadmap, Job Matching, Micro-Projects, AI Copilot, Applications, Interview Prep
  - User stays on `/dashboard` route - tab switching changes content without navigation
  - JobMatching routing logic gated behind embedded flag to prevent URL mutations
- **Technical Pattern**:
  - Each component accepts `embedded` prop (default false)
  - When `embedded=true`: renders content without Layout wrapper
  - When `embedded=false`: renders with Layout wrapper (for standalone routes)
  - Prevents Layout nesting while maintaining standalone functionality
- **User Experience**: 
  - Login → Dashboard → Select any tab → Content appears instantly (no page load)
  - Truly single-page experience - everything stays on the dashboard
  - Standalone routes still work for direct access (e.g., `/resume`, `/jobs`)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Zero navigation friction - all features one tab click away
  - Faster switching between features (no page reloads)
  - Cleaner URL structure (stays on `/dashboard`)
  - All functionality preserved with backward compatibility

### Resume Analysis Paywall (October 2025)
- **Purpose**: Monetization strategy to convert free users to Pro subscription
- **Restricted Features for Free Users**:
  - Sub-score details (Skills, Experience, Education, Keywords analysis) - blurred with upgrade overlay
  - Improvement Recommendations section - blurred with upgrade overlay
  - Overall resume score and upload functionality remain accessible to free users
- **Component**: `PaywallOverlay.tsx` - reusable component with blur effect and "Unlock with Pro" message
- **User Experience**: 
  - Free users see blurred content when clicking sub-score cards
  - "Upgrade to Pro" button redirects to Stripe checkout for $10/month subscription
  - Clear visual hierarchy with lock icon and value proposition
- **Implementation**: Uses `useAuth` hook to check `subscriptionTier` and conditionally render paywall
- **Stripe Integration**: Upgrade button calls `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session` endpoint

### Landing Page Subscription Plans (October 2025)
- **Updated Hero Stats**: Replaced generic "100% Free for Students" stat with detailed subscription plan cards
- **Three-Tier Display**:
  - Institutional: Full access for invited students with institution branding
  - Free ($0): Resume Analysis with AI and AI Career Co-Pilot
  - Pro ($10/month): Full feature access marked as "Most Popular"
- **Feature Breakdowns**: Each plan shows specific features with checkmark bullets
- **Design**: Card-based layout with icons, pricing, and feature lists for easy comparison

### Professional Landing Page
- **Purpose**: Provide a welcoming entry point for new users before authentication
- **Design**: Modern, professional landing page with gradient hero section and feature showcase

  - Step-by-step "How It Works" guide
  - Benefits grid with checkmarks for key selling points
  - Call-to-action sections with prominent signup buttons
  - Professional footer with branding
- **Routing**: Root path (/) now displays landing page for unauthenticated users; authenticated users redirected to role-based dashboards
- **Component**: `LandingPage.tsx` with full responsive design and consistent theming

### User Settings & Profile Management

- **Editable Fields**: firstName, lastName, school, major, gradYear, targetRole, location, remoteOk
- **API**: PATCH /api/users/settings endpoint for authenticated profile updates
- **Access**: Settings dialog accessible via gear icon in sidebar
- **Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity

### Micro-Projects Feature - Role-Based AI Generation
- **Purpose**: Generate portfolio-ready micro-projects (1-2 weeks) tailored to specific career roles
- **AI Generation**: Role-based project creation using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured deliverables
- **Schema Updates**: Added `targetRole`, `skillsGained`, `relevanceToRole` fields; restructured deliverables as step objects with embedded resource links
- **Key Features**:
  - Target role input (e.g., "Data Scientist", "Product Manager")
  - Generates 1-3 projects per role with actionable steps
  - Each project includes: numbered deliverables with clickable resource links, skills gained badges, relevance explanation
  - Portfolio-ready outcomes with real datasets/APIs/resources (no mock data)
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/micro-projects/generate-from-role` accepts `targetRole` and `count` parameters
- **UI Components**: Enhanced project cards displaying structured deliverables, resource links with type badges, skills gained, and role relevance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy skill-gap-based generation still supported alongside new role-based approach

### Beyond Jobs Feature - Tabbed Interface
- **UI Restructure**: "Beyond Jobs" is now a sub-tab under "Job Matching" instead of a separate page
- **Navigation**: Uses shadcn Tabs component with two tabs: "AI Job Matching" and "Beyond Jobs"
- **Routing**: Both /jobs and /beyond-jobs routes now point to the same JobMatching component
  - /beyond-jobs automatically selects the "Beyond Jobs" tab
  - Query parameter ?tab=beyond-jobs can be used to select the tab
- **Components**:
  - `JobMatching.tsx` - Parent wrapper with Layout and Tabs
  - `AIJobMatching.tsx` - AI-powered job matching tab (child component, no Layout)
  - `BeyondJobsTab.tsx` - Experiential opportunities tab (child component, no Layout)
