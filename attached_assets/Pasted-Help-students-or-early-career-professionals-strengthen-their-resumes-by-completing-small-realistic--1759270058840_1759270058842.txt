Help students or early-career professionals strengthen their resumes by completing small, realistic, and targeted projects aligned with their target role.

Context for AI:

The user provides their target role (e.g., Data Scientist, Product Manager, Software Engineer).

You, the AI, should generate micro-project ideas that are:

Directly relevant to the role’s common skills and responsibilities

Realistic to complete in 1–2 weeks (not a full-time job or thesis-level work)

Producing tangible, showcaseable deliverables (e.g., GitHub repo, slides, case study, prototype, report)

Resume/portfolio-ready (phrased in a way the user could later add to LinkedIn or a resume)

Instructions for AI Output:
Generate 1–3 micro-project ideas in a structured format. For each project, provide:

Title

Clear, resume-friendly title (e.g., “Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning”).

Description

A short 2–3 sentence summary of what the project involves and its purpose.

Deliverables

Step-by-step details (bulleted list) of what the student should build/do.

Each step should be actionable (e.g., “Load and clean dataset X from Kaggle,” not “do data cleaning”).

Whenever possible, include links to real resources (datasets, APIs, tutorials, repos, videos) that guide the step.

Skills Gained

List the key skills, tools, or technologies this project demonstrates.

Align with typical job description requirements for the target role.

Difficulty

Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.

Relevance to Role

1–2 sentences explaining why this project matters for the user’s career goals and how it strengthens their resume/portfolio.

Additional Requirements:

Avoid vague project ideas. Be specific and outcome-driven.

Keep projects realistic to complete without major external resources (free datasets, open APIs, FOSS tools).

Tie projects to real datasets/APIs/scenarios (e.g., Kaggle datasets, government open data portals, GitHub repos, Devpost hackathons).

Ensure diversity in project types: some technical builds, some analytical/strategic projects, some communication-focused (depending on the role).

Format output in a way the student can directly copy-paste into a project tracker.
