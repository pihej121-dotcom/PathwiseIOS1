⚙️ Replit AI Prompts for Phase 1

Prompt 1: Create the Institutions Schema

Create a Drizzle ORM schema for an institutions table with the following fields:

id (uuid primary key)

name (text)

adminEmail (text)

studentLimit (integer)

licenseStart (timestamp, default now)

licenseEnd (timestamp)

registrationToken (text, required)

tokenExpiresAt (timestamp, required)

createdBy (text, super_admin email)

isActive (boolean, default true)

Use Drizzle conventions and link this table to the existing users table through adminEmail.

Prompt 2: Super Admin Dashboard (React + Next.js)

Build a SuperAdminDashboard page (Next.js + shadcn + Tailwind) that lists all institutions from /api/admin/institutions.
Include columns for: Institution Name, Admin Email, Student Limit, License Duration, Status, Actions.
Add a button “Onboard Institution” → opens a modal form (name, admin email, student limit, license start/end).
On submit, call /api/admin/onboard-institution.
Use toasts for success/failure.

Prompt 3: Onboarding API with Resend Integration

Build an Express endpoint /api/admin/onboard-institution:

Requires requireSuperAdmin middleware.

Accepts name, adminEmail, studentLimit, licenseEnd, createdBy.

Generates registrationToken (uuid).

Sets tokenExpiresAt = 7 days from now.

Inserts into DB.

Uses Resend to send an email to adminEmail with:
“You’ve been invited to register your Institution on Pathwise. Click below to finish setup: https://pathwise.nyc/register/institution?token={token}”

Returns success JSON.

Include an email template file in /emails/InstitutionInvite.tsx with a clean Pathwise brand style.
